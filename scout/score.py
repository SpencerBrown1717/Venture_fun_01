"""Startup Opportunity Scoring Engine (stretch goal 4).

Produces explainable 0-100 sub-scores across six venture dimensions plus an
overall score and a confidence estimate. Scores blend three transparent inputs:

  1. Category priors (market size / timing / defensibility differ by subsector).
  2. Company-specific evidence (classifier confidence, signal density,
     description specificity, discovered founder pedigree).
  3. A small deterministic per-company variation (hashed from the id) so peers
     in the same category don't collapse to identical numbers.

Everything is heuristic and *illustrative* — see README limitations. The point
is a defensible, auditable scaffold a real data layer can later plug into.
