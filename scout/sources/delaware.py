"""Reliable Delaware incorporation source (EDGAR-backed).

Delaware's own ICIS portal has no bulk API and discourages scraping, so for a
robust, *legitimate* feed of newly formed Delaware firms we use SEC EDGAR's
state-of-incorporation filter: Form D filers whose `inc_state == DE`. These are
real entities incorporated in Delaware, each with a verifiable SEC CIK and a
public filing — discoverable months before they hit mainstream databases.

Free, official, no API key, no anti-bot fight. `days_back` controls the window
so we catch firms in their first weeks of activity.
