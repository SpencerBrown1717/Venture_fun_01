# AI Incorporation Scout Agent

> An autonomous agent that discovers newly formed companies from public sources,
> classifies how AI-related they are, builds intelligence on them, and surfaces
> the results in an investor-facing dashboard — *before* they hit mainstream
> startup databases.

This is a **Week 1** submission for the AI Incorporation Scout assignment, plus
**most of the Week 2 stretch goals**: a multi-agent *Venture Analyst Swarm*
(research memos, founder discovery, opportunity scoring, competitive landscapes,
and a final recommendation), trend detection, a natural-language query
interface, and an always-on GitHub Actions deployment.

## What it does

A pipeline of cooperating, specialized agents — the **Venture Analyst Swarm** —
turns a raw public record into an investor-ready recommendation:

```
   DISCOVERY → CLASSIFIER → RESEARCH → FOUNDER → SCORING → MARKET → REPORTING
   (sources)   (AI score)   (memo +    (team    (6-dim   (leaders  (verdict +
                            website)   profiles) opp)     + peers)  rationale)
                                          │
                                          ▼
                                    STORE (SQLite) ── export ──▶ static dashboard
                                                                  (GitHub Pages)
```

1. **Discovery** — collect newly formed company records from public sources
   (live SEC EDGAR Form D filings + a bundled offline sample dataset).
2. **Classifier** — transparent, calibrated AI-relatedness score (`0..1`) and a
   subsector category. Optional LLM upgrade.
3. **Research** *(stretch 1)* — visit the website, estimate market & stage, draft
   a one-page investment memo.
4. **Founder** *(stretch 2)* — structured founder/executive profiles.
5. **Scoring** *(stretch 4)* — a 6-dimension opportunity score + confidence.
6. **Market** *(stretch 5)* — competitive landscape: real category leaders,
   discovered peers, white space.
7. **Reporting** *(stretch 3)* — synthesize into a final recommendation
   (verdict + conviction + rationale).
8. **Store & Export** — persist to SQLite (idempotent upserts) and emit a
   precomputed `data.json` powering a static dashboard with a Top-Opportunities
   leaderboard, grouping/sorting/filtering, trend charts *(stretch 6)*, and
   natural-language search *(stretch 7)*.

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+. The core pipeline uses only the standard
library — **no install required**.

```bash
# 1. Generate the bundled sample dataset (synthetic but realistic)
python -m scout gen-sample

# 2. Discover + classify + research from the offline sample, then export
python -m scout run --source sample --research --export

# 3. Open the dashboard
cd dashboard && python -m http.server 8000
# visit http://localhost:8000
```

That's it. The committed `dashboard/data.json` means the dashboard also works
the instant you deploy it — no pipeline run needed.

### Run against the live SEC EDGAR source

Form D filings (notices of exempt securities offerings) are filed by recently
formed entities raising their first private capital — a strong leading signal
for "newly formed company" discovery.

```bash
python -m scout run \
  --source sec_edgar \
  --query '"artificial intelligence"' \
  --days-back 120 --limit 50 \
  --user-agent "AI-Incorporation-Scout/0.1 (you@example.com)" \
  --research --export
```

> SEC's fair-access policy asks for a descriptive `User-Agent` with a contact
> email. No API key is required.

### Optional: LLM-powered classification & memos

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt        # installs the optional `openai` client
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python -m scout run --source sample --llm --research --export
```

If the key or package is missing, the pipeline **automatically falls back** to
the heuristic classifier and heuristic memos — it never hard-fails.

### CLI reference

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `python -m scout gen-sample` | (Re)generate the bundled sample dataset |
| `python -m scout run` | Discover → classify → (research) → store |
| `python -m scout export` | Re-export `dashboard/data.json` from the DB |
| `python -m scout stats` | Print database stats |

Useful `run` flags: `--source {sample,sec_edgar}`, `--limit N`, `--llm`,
`--research`, `--no-fetch-site`, `--export`, `--query`, `--days-back`,
`--forms`, `--user-agent`.

## Deploying the dashboard to GitHub Pages

There are two supported paths:

**A. GitHub Actions (recommended, always-on — stretch goal 8).**
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs the pipeline (offline sample baseline + a
best-effort live SEC EDGAR enrichment) and publishes `dashboard/` to Pages on
every push, on a **daily schedule**, and on manual dispatch — so the public
dashboard keeps refreshing itself with no manual intervention.

> One-time setup: repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source =
> GitHub Actions**. The dashboard then serves at the site root.

**B. Deploy from branch (zero config).**
Set **Settings → Pages → Source = Deploy from a branch**, branch `main`, folder
`/ (root)`. The root `index.html` redirects to `./dashboard/`, which reads its
committed `data.json`.

To refresh data manually: re-run the pipeline with `--export` and commit the
updated `dashboard/data.json`.

### Data model

A `Company` carries collection metadata (name, source, jurisdiction, formation
date, website, description), classifier output (`ai_score`, `is_ai`,
`ai_signals`, `ai_category`), and an optional research `memo`. IDs are a
deterministic hash of `source + source_id`, so re-running the pipeline
**upserts** rather than duplicating.

### Classifier

The default heuristic classifier is intentionally **transparent**: every score
ships with the exact signals that produced it (e.g. `"machine learning (name)"`),
which matters for investor trust and for debugging false positives. Weighted
evidence (strong phrases like *"large language model"* count more than weak,
ambiguous tokens like a bare *"AI"*) is squashed through a logistic function
into a calibrated `0..1` confidence, with field weighting (a name match counts
more than a description match) and whole-word matching to avoid false positives
like *"Mountain **AI**r"*.

### The analyst swarm (stretch goals 1–5)

For companies above a confidence threshold, a sequence of specialized agents
runs (orchestrated in `pipeline.py`):

- **Research** (`research/memo.py`) optionally fetches the website
  (dependency-free HTML→text), estimates market & stage, and drafts a memo:
  one-liner, thesis, reasoning, market read, risks. Degrades *LLM prose →
  site-enriched heuristic → metadata-only heuristic*; always produces a memo.
- **Founder** (`founders.py`) emits structured founder profiles. With `--llm`
  and fetched site text it extracts named people; otherwise it generates clearly
  **labeled synthetic** profiles so the product is fully demonstrable offline.
- **Scoring** (`score.py`) produces six explainable 0–100 sub-scores (team,
  market, differentiation, technical, defensibility, timing) blending category
  priors, company evidence, and a deterministic per-company variation, plus an
  overall score and an evidence-based confidence.
- **Market** (`competitive.py`) maps each company to real category leaders (from
  a curated KB), discovered peers in the dataset, and a white-space prompt.
- **Reporting** (`recommend.py`) synthesizes the above into a verdict
  (*Strong interest → Track → Monitor → Pass*), a conviction level, and a
  rationale citing the strongest/weakest signals.

### Trend detection (stretch goal 6)

`export.py` precomputes AI discovery momentum by month, category & geographic
distributions, and which categories are accelerating vs. cooling month over
month — rendered as charts in the dashboard's **Trend Intelligence** panel.

### Natural language interface (stretch goal 7)

The dashboard search box accepts queries like *"AI infrastructure companies
founded this month"* or *"developer tools last 30 days"*. A lightweight
client-side intent parser maps category synonyms, time windows, and confidence
intent onto the existing filter controls — no backend required.

## Design decisions

- **Standard-library core, optional everything else.** The pipeline runs with
  zero `pip install`. The LLM is an *enhancement*, never a dependency, so the
  project is reproducible on any machine. This keeps the "unlock" friction-free.
- **SQLite, not Postgres.** A single-file DB keeps the project portable and
  zero-setup while still giving real schema, indexes, and idempotent upserts.
  The `db.py` interface is small enough to swap for Postgres later.
- **Static dashboard with precomputed data.** All aggregation happens in Python
  and is baked into `data.json`. The front-end stays dependency-free and
  deploys to GitHub Pages with no build step — exactly the assignment's target.
- **Pluggable source connectors.** A `Source` ABC + registry means adding
  Companies House (UK), OpenCorporates, or state registries is a single new
  file. SEC EDGAR Form D was chosen as the first *live* source because it is
  free, key-less, and a genuine early-formation signal.
- **Fail-soft everywhere.** A bad record or flaky network degrades a single
  item, never the whole run — essential for an unattended, continuously running
  agent.
- **Transparent scoring.** Explainable signals over a black box, so an investor
  can trust (and audit) why a company surfaced.

---

## Known limitations

- **Sample data is synthetic.** `gen-sample` produces realistic-but-fake records
  so the demo runs offline. The live `sec_edgar` source pulls real filings.
- **Form D ≠ all new companies.** EDGAR Form D captures entities raising exempt
  securities; it misses companies that haven't raised, and includes some funds
  /SPVs. It's a high-signal *slice*, not full incorporation coverage. Adding a
  state-registry or Companies House connector would broaden the funnel.
- **Founder profiles are synthetic by default.** Reliable founder data for
  brand-new companies requires paid people-data APIs (PeopleDataLabs, Clearbit,
  LinkedIn). The default agent generates clearly-labeled illustrative profiles
  (every profile carries `"source": "synthetic"`); the `--llm` path extracts
  real names from website text when available. Nothing is presented as verified.
- **Opportunity scores are heuristic/illustrative.** They blend category priors
  with available evidence and a deterministic per-company variation — a
  defensible, auditable scaffold, not a calibrated model. They're meant to show
  the *structure*; a real data layer (funding, traction, team graph) plugs in
  behind the same interface.
- **Competitive leaders are a curated snapshot.** Grounded in real companies but
  not exhaustive or live; adjacency grows as the scout discovers more peers.
- **Heuristic classifier has blind spots.** It keys on names/descriptions, so a
  genuinely-AI company with a generic name and no description can be missed
  (false negative), and a buzzword-stuffed non-AI company can score high (false
  positive). The `--llm` path mitigates this.
- **Website fetch is best-effort.** JS-heavy sites yield little text via the
  static fetch; many brand-new companies have no site yet.
- **Stage estimation is coarse.** Inferred from on-page/registry text cues only;
  no funding database is wired in yet.
- **No scheduler included.** Continuous operation (stretch goal 8) is a `cron`/
  GitHub Action away — the pipeline is already idempotent and incremental.
