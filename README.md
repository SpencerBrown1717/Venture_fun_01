# SCOUT — Pre-Form-D Venture Radar

> An agentic venture-discovery system that finds AI-native companies *before*
> they become obvious through public funding databases — separating **verified
> evidence** from **inference** at every step, and ranking what may become
> visible next.

> **Form D shows what has already become visible. The Pre-Form-D Radar shows
> what may become visible next.**

This is a complete build of the **OpenClaw Venture Radar / Pre-Form-D Startup
Discovery** assignment, plus **most of the frontier stretch**: a multi-agent
*Venture Analyst Swarm* (research memos, founder discovery, opportunity scoring,
competitive landscapes, a final recommendation), trend/momentum detection, a
local review workflow, a natural-language query interface, and an always-on
GitHub Actions deployment.

The deliverable is an editorial, minimal, single-page analyst tool: dark,
typographic, calm — built so an evaluator understands the value within 60
seconds.

## What it does

A pipeline of cooperating, specialized agents — the **Venture Analyst Swarm** —
turns a raw public record into an investor-ready recommendation:

```
   DISCOVERY → CLASSIFIER → RESEARCH → FOUNDER → SCORING → MARKET → REPORTING
   (sources)   (AI score)   (memo +    (team    (6-dim   (leaders  (verdict +
                            website)   profiles) opp)     + peers)  rationale)
                                          │
                                          ▼
                                    STORE (SQLite) ── export ──▶ static dashboard
                                                                  (GitHub Pages)
```

1. **Discovery** — collect newly formed company records from public sources
   (live SEC EDGAR Form D filings + a bundled offline sample dataset).
2. **Classifier** — transparent, calibrated AI-relatedness score (`0..1`) and a
   subsector category. Optional LLM upgrade.
3. **Research** *(stretch 1)* — visit the website, estimate market & stage, draft
   a one-page investment memo.
4. **Founder** *(stretch 2)* — structured founder/executive profiles.
5. **Scoring** *(stretch 4)* — a 6-dimension opportunity score + confidence.
6. **Market** *(stretch 5)* — competitive landscape: real category leaders,
   discovered peers, white space.
7. **Reporting** *(stretch 3)* — synthesize into a final recommendation
   (verdict + conviction + rationale).
8. **Store & Export** — persist to SQLite (idempotent upserts) and emit a
   precomputed `data.json` powering a static dashboard with a Top-Opportunities
   leaderboard, grouping/sorting/filtering, trend charts *(stretch 6)*, and
   natural-language search *(stretch 7)*.

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+. The core pipeline uses only the standard
library — **no install required**.

```bash
# 1. Build/grow the dataset from REAL Delaware incorporations.
#    Harvests firms *incorporated in DE* that filed a Form D, month by month
#    across the whole year, from SEC EDGAR — every record has a verifiable SEC
#    CIK. Pooled funds are dropped; each run MERGES into the existing dataset so
#    it grows organically as new C-corps form. No scraping, no API key.
python -m scout gen-sample --since 2026-01-01 --limit 400

# 2. Discover + classify + research from the sample, then export
python -m scout run --source sample --research --export

# 3. Open the dashboard
cd dashboard && python -m http.server 8000
# visit http://localhost:8000
```

That's it. The committed `dashboard/data.json` means the dashboard also works
the instant you deploy it — no pipeline run needed.

### How we get real Delaware firms (and prove they're real)

Delaware has no public bulk API, and its ICIS portal explicitly **discourages
data mining** (and is anti-automation, so scraping it is both fragile and against
its terms). Instead we use a **legitimate, free, official** signal:

> **SEC EDGAR's state-of-incorporation filter.** Newly formed Delaware entities
> that raise any private capital file a **Form D**, and EDGAR lets you query for
> filers whose state of *incorporation* is `DE`
> (`locationType=incorporated&locationCodes=DE`).

This gives real DE-incorporated companies, in their first weeks, each with a
**verifiable SEC CIK and a public filing** — months before they hit mainstream
startup databases. No API key, no anti-bot fight, updates continuously.

```bash
# The reliable Delaware feed (EDGAR-backed)
python -m scout run --source delaware \
  --query '"artificial intelligence" OR robotics OR autonomous' \
  --days-back 60 --research --export
```

**Every company is verified real.** On ingest each record is checked against
independent, auditable signals and tagged `verified_real` with provenance:

- an **SEC EDGAR CIK** (a registered filer with a public filing), and/or
- a **website that resolves** over HTTP/DNS.

The dashboard shows a **✓ Verified** badge on each card that links straight to
the source SEC filing, plus a "Verification" section in the analysis drawer.

> The original ICIS scraper is kept as a separate, best-effort source
> (`--source delaware_icis`) for completeness, but it is **not** used for the
> sample or the scheduled refresh because the portal is unreliable.

### The dashboard — an analyst workflow in five tabs

The static dashboard (`dashboard/`) is organized around the assignment's required
operator workflow. It reads a single precomputed `data.json` and needs no build
step or backend.

- **Data Health** — an always-visible operator panel: generated-at, sources,
  total / AI / pre-Form-D / confirmed counts, average evidence & opportunity,
  verified-website and founder coverage, and your review-queue size.
- **All Companies** — the full feed with natural-language search and filters for
  AI category, financing signal, source tier, **source type**, review status,
  **min evidence**, and **min opportunity**.
- **Pre-Form-D Radar** — the headline view: probable SAFE-stage / pre-seed AI
  companies with *no public Form D yet*, framed explicitly as inference.
- **Confirmed Form D** — the SEC-verified ground truth the radar anticipates,
  each card linked to its authoritative EDGAR record.
- **Needs Review** — a local triage queue. Set any company to **Needs review**,
  **Track weekly**, **Outreach ready**, or **Pass** (stored in `localStorage`,
  no backend) and it groups here.
- **Leaderboard** — top AI companies by opportunity score, with category and
  momentum signals beneath.
- **Startups to Watch** — recently *funded* AI-native startups from a **VC
  deals export**: confirmed financing rounds with round size and the full
  investor syndicate. Where the radar infers, this is reported — a complement to
  the pre-Form-D layer. Built via `python -m scout watch` → `dashboard/watch.json`.

Every company opens an **analysis drawer** with the recommendation, an
evidence panel ("Why this company is here" — sources used vs. missing-data
checklist), the **recommended next action**, triage controls, founders, the
6-dimension opportunity score, competitive landscape, risks, and verification.

### Pre-Form-D Radar — catching companies *before* the financing signal

Form D shows what has already become visible. But many of the best companies
raise on **SAFEs**, are pre-seed, or are stealth — so they have **no useful Form
D yet**. The **Pre-Form-D Radar** adds that earlier layer from a real,
open-source signal:

> **The open YC dataset** (`yc-oss/api`) — a public mirror of Y Combinator's
> company directory. YC companies are the canonical SAFE-stage / pre-Form-D
> companies, each with a real website and an authoritative YC profile page.

```bash
# Form D companies + the pre-Form-D (accelerator) radar, scored together:
python -m scout run --source sample --research --include-pre-form-d --export
# or just the accelerator feed:
python -m scout discover --source accelerators --research --export
```

Every record runs through an **inference layer** (`scout/inference/`) that labels
it transparently — never claiming a SAFE was confirmed:

- **Source tier** (1 SEC-confirmed → 5 weak/name-only).
- **Financing-stage inference**: `Confirmed Form D`, `Probable SAFE-stage`,
  `Pre-Form-D / early signal`, … (an inference about *visibility*, not a
  confirmed financing event).
- **Evidence score** (how much we *know*) kept **separate** from the
  **opportunity score** (how *interesting* it looks) — so a promising company
  with thin evidence is shown as high-opportunity / low-confidence, never as
  high-confidence.
- **Source records** + a **missing-data checklist** powering the drawer's "Why
  this company is here" evidence panel, with every source linked.

**Honesty-first:** founders are only ever shown when they come from a verified
source (SEC filing or website extraction). We **never fabricate** founder
identities; unknown founders are shown as unknown.

A lightweight de-duplication layer (`scout/dedupe/`) merges the same startup when
it appears in both the accelerator feed and a later Form D filing, preserving all
source provenance.

### Run against the live SEC EDGAR source

Form D filings (notices of exempt securities offerings) are filed by recently
formed entities raising their first private capital — a strong leading signal
for "newly formed company" discovery.

```bash
python -m scout run \
  --source sec_edgar \
  --query '"artificial intelligence"' \
  --days-back 120 --limit 50 \
  --user-agent "AI-Incorporation-Scout/0.1 (you@example.com)" \
  --research --export
```

> SEC's fair-access policy asks for a descriptive `User-Agent` with a contact
> email. No API key is required.

### Optional: LLM-powered classification & memos

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt        # installs the optional `openai` client
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python -m scout run --source sample --llm --research --export
```

If the key or package is missing, the pipeline **automatically falls back** to
the heuristic classifier and heuristic memos — it never hard-fails.

## Deploying the dashboard to GitHub Pages

There are two supported paths:

**A. GitHub Actions (recommended, always-on — stretch goal 8).**
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` grows the dataset from the **reliable
EDGAR-backed Delaware feed** (harvesting the whole year month-by-month and
**merging** new C-corps into the existing corpus), runs the full analyst swarm,
commits the refreshed data, and publishes `dashboard/` to Pages on every push,
on a **monthly schedule** (so the feed fills up as new companies form), and on
manual dispatch — so the public dashboard keeps growing with no manual intervention.

> One-time setup: repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source =
> GitHub Actions**. The dashboard then serves at the site root.

**B. Deploy from branch (zero config).**
Set **Settings → Pages → Source = Deploy from a branch**, branch `main`, folder
`/ (root)`. The root `index.html` redirects to `./dashboard/`, which reads its
committed `data.json`.

To refresh data manually: re-run the pipeline with `--export` and commit the
updated `dashboard/data.json`.

### Data model

A `Company` carries collection metadata (name, source, jurisdiction, formation
date, website, description), classifier output (`ai_score`, `is_ai`,
`ai_signals`, `ai_category`), and an optional research `memo`. IDs are a
deterministic hash of `source + source_id`, so re-running the pipeline
**upserts** rather than duplicating.

### Classifier

The default heuristic classifier is intentionally **transparent**: every score
ships with the exact signals that produced it (e.g. `"machine learning (name)"`),
which matters for investor trust and for debugging false positives. Weighted
evidence (strong phrases like *"large language model"* count more than weak,
ambiguous tokens like a bare *"AI"*) is squashed through a logistic function
into a calibrated `0..1` confidence, with field weighting (a name match counts
more than a description match) and whole-word matching to avoid false positives
like *"Mountain **AI**r"*.

### The analyst swarm (stretch goals 1–5)

For companies above a confidence threshold, a sequence of specialized agents
runs (orchestrated in `pipeline.py`):

- **Research** (`research/memo.py`) optionally fetches the website
  (dependency-free HTML→text), estimates market & stage, and drafts a memo:
  one-liner, thesis, reasoning, market read, risks. Degrades *LLM prose →
  site-enriched heuristic → metadata-only heuristic*; always produces a memo.
- **Founder** (`founders.py` + `edgar_detail.py`) prefers the **real officers and
  directors named in the company's SEC Form D filing** (`"source": "sec_filing"`) —
  actual people, with role, city/state, and a LinkedIn people-search link. When a
  filing has no named people it falls back to LLM website extraction (`--llm`) or
  clearly **labeled synthetic** profiles, so the product is always demonstrable.
- **Scoring** (`score.py`) produces six explainable 0–100 sub-scores (team,
  market, differentiation, technical, defensibility, timing) blending category
  priors, company evidence, and a deterministic per-company variation, plus an
  overall score and an evidence-based confidence.
- **Market** (`competitive.py`) maps each company to real category leaders (from
  a curated KB), discovered peers in the dataset, and a white-space prompt.
- **Reporting** (`recommend.py`) synthesizes the above into a verdict
  (*Strong interest → Track → Monitor → Pass*), a conviction level, and a
  rationale citing the strongest/weakest signals.

### Trend detection (stretch goal 6)

`export.py` precomputes AI discovery momentum by month, category & geographic
distributions, and which categories are accelerating vs. cooling month over
month — rendered as charts in the dashboard's **Trend Intelligence** panel.

### Natural language interface (stretch goal 7)

The dashboard search box accepts queries like *"AI infrastructure companies
founded this month"* or *"developer tools last 30 days"*. A lightweight
client-side intent parser maps category synonyms, time windows, and confidence
intent onto the existing filter controls — no backend required.

---

## Design decisions

- **Standard-library core, optional everything else.** The pipeline runs with
  zero `pip install`. The LLM is an *enhancement*, never a dependency, so the
  project is reproducible on any machine. This keeps the "unlock" friction-free.
- **SQLite, not Postgres.** A single-file DB keeps the project portable and
  zero-setup while still giving real schema, indexes, and idempotent upserts.
  The `db.py` interface is small enough to swap for Postgres later.
- **Static dashboard with precomputed data.** All aggregation happens in Python
  and is baked into `data.json`. The front-end stays dependency-free and
  deploys to GitHub Pages with no build step — exactly the assignment's target.
- **Pluggable source connectors.** A `Source` ABC + registry means adding
  Companies House (UK), OpenCorporates, or state registries is a single new
  file. SEC EDGAR Form D was chosen as the first *live* source because it is
  free, key-less, and a genuine early-formation signal.
- **Fail-soft everywhere.** A bad record or flaky network degrades a single
  item, never the whole run — essential for an unattended, continuously running
  agent.
- **Transparent scoring.** Explainable signals over a black box, so an investor
  can trust (and audit) why a company surfaced.

---

## Known limitations

- **Sample data uses real public companies.** The offline demo dataset lists real AI
  companies with **verified working websites** (checked on ingest via DNS/HTTP).
  Formation dates and jurisdictions are illustrative so the pipeline runs
  offline; live `sec_edgar` pulls real filings. Non-AI noise records omit
  websites (typical for early local formations).
- **Form D ≠ all new companies — and skews to hardware/robotics.** EDGAR Form D
  captures entities raising *priced/exempt* rounds. Many AI **software** startups
  raise on SAFEs (no Form D), so the operating-company slice that surfaces skews
  toward robotics/hardware (which file Form D for priced rounds). We drop pooled
  funds/SPVs to keep real operating companies. It's a high-signal *slice*, not
  full incorporation coverage; a state-registry connector would broaden the funnel.
- **Founders are real when the filing names them.** Officers/directors come
  straight from the SEC Form D (`"source": "sec_filing"`) with a LinkedIn
  people-search link to reach the actual person. Only when a filing lists no
  individuals do we fall back to LLM extraction or clearly-labeled synthetic
  profiles — and the source is always shown, so nothing masquerades as verified.
- **Opportunity scores are heuristic/illustrative.** They blend category priors
  with available evidence and a deterministic per-company variation — a
  defensible, auditable scaffold, not a calibrated model. They're meant to show
  the *structure*; a real data layer (funding, traction, team graph) plugs in
  behind the same interface.
- **Competitive leaders are a curated snapshot.** Grounded in real companies but
  not exhaustive or live; adjacency grows as the scout discovers more peers.
- **Heuristic classifier has blind spots.** It keys on names/descriptions, so a
  genuinely-AI company with a generic name and no description can be missed
  (false negative), and a buzzword-stuffed non-AI company can score high (false
  positive). The `--llm` path mitigates this.
- **Website fetch is best-effort.** JS-heavy sites yield little text via the
  static fetch; many brand-new companies have no site yet.
- **Stage estimation is coarse.** Inferred from on-page/registry text cues only;
  no funding database is wired in yet.
- **No scheduler included.** Continuous operation (stretch goal 8) is a `cron`/
  GitHub Action away — the pipeline is already idempotent and incremental.
